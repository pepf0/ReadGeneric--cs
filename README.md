This is my Generic "Read" Method. It can be used to read an input from the console and returns the variable. 
if the conversion fails(for example 'a' cant be parsed into Int32) it displays an error message.
If you try it with an object, youll get a corresponding error message and it returns the default of the object.

Please note that I'm a beginner coder, so this code isnt the best ;)
